Data description
-------------------

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducted a study on 768 adult female Pima Indians living near Phoenix. The following variables were recorded: Number of times pregnant, Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test, Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), Triceps skin fold thickness (mm), 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml), Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m2)), Diabetes pedigree function, Age (years) and a test whether the patient shows signs of diabetes (coded 0 if negative, 1 if positive).


Questions
----------

a)	Fit the most parsimonious multiple regression explaining diastolic pressure (Remember the model may contain interactions)
b)	Perform diagnostics on the best fitting model.
c)	Interpret the coefficients where possible.

Note:
Can use similar codes as in SBP_code.R script for model building process!!
