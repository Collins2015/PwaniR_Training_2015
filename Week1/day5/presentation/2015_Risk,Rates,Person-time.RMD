 Risk
-------
Probability of death in five years following diagnosis of Prostate cancer is defined as the proportion of times that this would occur among a large number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. The probability is then said to be the risk of death in the five year following diagnosis of prostate cancer

e.g. the incidence rate of prostate cancer is 74.3/100000 men/year 
Mortality rate for children less than five years in Kilifi county is 30 per 1000 child-years
