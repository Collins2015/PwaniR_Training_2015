### Point Estimation:
1. Provides a single value
  - Based on observations from one sample
2. Gives no information about how close the value is to the unknown population parameter
3. Example: Sample mean x = 3 is point estimate of unknown population mean

### Interval estimation:
1. Provides a range of values 
    - Based on observations from one sample
2. Gives information about closeness to unknown population parameter
  - Stated in terms of probability
    - Knowing exact closeness requires knowing unknown population parameter
3. Example: The range between 50 and 70 contains the true unknown parameter value with 95% confidence]

### Summary

- The confidence interval expresses the uncertainty in sample estimates of means, proportions, treatment efficacy etc.

- Larger the sample, the narrower the CI

- Can improve the probability of including the population mean by calculating 99% interval but at a cost of having a wider interval and thus greater uncertainty

- Should design studies to yield CI’s that are narrow enough to draw conclusions

- Interpretation depends on the assumption that the sample was representative of the population



### Exercise

- Suppose we’ve collected a random sample of 10 recently graduated students and asked them what their annual salary is. Imagine that this is the data we see, 44617,7066, 17594, 2726, 1178, 18898, 5033, 37151, 4514, and 4000.

- **Goal:** Estimate the mean salary of the graduated children. Find a 90 and 95 % confidence interval for the mean.

- **Setting 1:** Assume that incomes are normally distributed with unknown mean and SD = ksh15,000.


- **Setting 2:** Same problem, only now we do not know the value for the standard deviation.
